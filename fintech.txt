## Project 1: FinTech – Real-Time Fraud Detection Engine

### Project Title

**High-Throughput Transaction Guard**

### Product / Brand Name

**SentinelStream**

---

## 1. Production Use Case

A large-scale Neo-bank requires a **high-performance, low-latency fraud detection system** capable of processing **tens of thousands of credit card transactions per second**.

SentinelStream operates **between the external payment gateway and the bank’s internal ledger**, analyzing each transaction in **under 200 milliseconds** using:

* A **static, rule-based fraud engine**
* A **predictive, pre-trained Machine Learning model**

The system must instantly **approve or flag suspicious transactions** without blocking payment flows.

---

## 2. Core Functional Features

### Basic Functions

* User Transaction History API
* Current Balance Check API
* Secure, immutable transaction logging
* Standard REST-based API design
* Strong data integrity and persistence

---

## 3. Deep Production-Level Capabilities

### A. Concurrency & Data Integrity

**Idempotency Keys**

* Prevents double charging or duplicate ledger entries
* Handles retry scenarios when client requests timeout
* Implemented via middleware
* Unique request keys logged and validated per transaction

---

### B. Failure Recovery & Reliability

**Asynchronous Webhooks**

* Non-blocking merchant or third-party notifications
* Transaction status updates (Approved / Declined)
* Ensures delivery even during partial failures
* Implemented using **Celery + RabbitMQ**

---

### C. Fraud Rules Engine

**Dynamic Rule Engine**

* Configurable fraud rules defined by non-technical staff
* Example rule:

  * `IF transaction_amount > 5000 AND location != user_home → FLAG AS RISK`
* Rules stored in database
* Modular Python class-based architecture
* Evaluated in real time before ML scoring

---

### D. Machine Learning Intelligence

**ML-Based Risk Scoring**

* Real-time scoring using a **pre-trained Scikit-Learn pipeline**
* Outputs a fraud risk score between **0.0 – 1.0**
* Uses **Isolation Forest** for anomaly detection
* Focus on:

  * Model serialization
  * Low-latency inference
  * Fast feature engineering

---

## 4. System Architecture

### Technology Stack

* **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (ASGI, async, high concurrency)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Immutable financial ledger, ACID compliant)
* **Cache / Rate Limiting:** Redis
* **Async Tasks:** Celery + RabbitMQ
* **ORM:** SQLAlchemy (AsyncIO)
* **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Reverse Proxy & SSL:** Nginx

---

### Architecture Flow (Sequence)

1. User initiates transaction
2. Payment Gateway forwards request
3. SentinelStream FastAPI endpoint receives transaction
4. Rule Engine evaluation
5. ML Model risk scoring
6. PostgreSQL ledger write
7. Async webhook trigger (merchant notification)
8. Response returned to gateway

---

## 5. Validation & Performance Tools

* **FastAPI-Limiter** for burst traffic control
* **Redis** for hot data caching and session management
* **Pydantic** for strict request/response schema validation
* **Locust** for load testing
* **PyTest** for unit and integration testing

---

## 6. Weekly Execution Plan

### Week 1 – Planning & Architecture

**Goals**

* Define complete Software Requirement Specification (SRS)
* Design relational database schema
* Star Schema for analytics
* Setup GitHub repository
* Configure CI/CD using GitHub Actions

---

### Week 2 – Core Transaction Pipeline

**Goals**

* Develop high-speed `POST /transaction` endpoint
* Implement Redis caching for user profiles
* Integrate PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy AsyncIO

**Validation**

* Load testing using Locust
* Must sustain **≥ 100 requests/second** locally

---

### Week 3 – Intelligence Layer (Rules + ML)

**Goals**

* Integrate Isolation Forest anomaly detection model
* Fully implement dynamic Rule Engine
* Configure Celery workers for email alerts

**Validation**

* End-to-end latency consistently **< 200 ms**

---

### Week 4 – Finalization & Deployment

**Goals**

* Full Docker containerization
* Nginx reverse proxy configuration
* SSL termination and load distribution
* JWT-based endpoint security
* Comprehensive PyTest test suite

**Final Checks**
